# Food Tracker
This is a form that will allow you to record the type of food that you eat along with the macronutrient(s) that it falls under the most.
- The solution will be an HTML file with a script tag block containing JavaScript
- You will make a simple form that accepts two items per submission
- The first item will be text that allows the user to enter the name of the food that they ate (apple, chicken, peanuts, etc.)
- The second item will be checkboxes of macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein, fats)
- There will be a submit button that submits the info as a list on the page and updates the page
- There should be a clear button
